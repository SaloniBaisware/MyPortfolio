            I'm currently majoring in Bachelor of Computer Application, with a minor in anchoring, at SGBAU University. <br>
            I knew that i wanted to go into computers and programming from day one, so I chose a university with strong <br>
            faculties in my field. My BCA degree definitely going to improve my coding skills. While I was in school,<br>
            I got a lot of hands-on event planning and experience from extracurriculars, too. But all above everything,<br>
            the most loving and comfortable work for me is when my hands are on my keyboard and working on web development <br>
            project.  My major has taught me the programming fundamentals, while my minor has taught me the soft skills necessary to succeed.
